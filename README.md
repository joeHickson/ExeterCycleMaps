## Tube Map

Designed in the london underground style. Captures routes and quality. Limited local info, no junction info and no terrain.

Each route is classified on a scale of 1-4:
* q1 = Busy road with little to no infrastructure. Avoided by nervous cyclists and not suitable for children
* q2 = Poor quality shared use path or roads with low speeds and low traffic volumes. Suitable for a teenager to use unsupervised.
* q3 = Traffic free route. Dedicated cycle path or wide shared use. Suitable for a 7 year old to use with limited supervision.
* q4 = Segregated cycle path meeting minimum widths of 2m single direction or 3m bidirectional.
