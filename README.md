## Tube Map

Designed in the london underground style. Captures routes and quality. Limited local info, no junction info and no terrain.

Each route is classified on a scale of 1-4:
* q1 = Busy road with little to no infrastructure. Avoided by nervous cyclists and not suitable for children
* q2 = Poor quality shared use path or roads with low speeds and low traffic volumes. Suitable for a teenager to use unsupervised.
* q3 = Traffic free route. Dedicated cycle path or wide shared use. Suitable for a 7 year old to use with limited supervision. Unable to maintain continuous flow in both directions with pedestrians present.
* q4 = Segregated cycle path meeting minimum widths of 1m single direction or 2m bidirectional (continuous flow in both directions) with few crossings to break the flow.
* q5 = Segregated cycle path meeting minimum widths of 2m single direction or 3m bidirectional (continuous flow with social cycling or overtaking) with few crossings to break the flow.

| Q | Traffic | Other Users | Capacity | Competency level |
|---|---------|-------------|----------|------------------|
|1|Busy / Fast| Vehicular | Limited | High / Very confident |
|2 (quiet residential) |Quiet & Slow | Light vehicular | High (typically good width) | Medium |
|2 (narrow shared use) |n/a| Pedestrians | Very limited (dodging pedestrians / oncoming bikes). Typically very broken routes with lots of road crossings. | Low |
| 3 | n/a | Pedestrians (possibly) | Medium | Low |
| 4 | n/a | none | Medium High | Low |
| 5 | n/a | none | High | Low |
